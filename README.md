# Android Beer Catalog (MVVM App)

**Author**: [IsaacRF239](https://isaacrf.com/about)

**Minimum SDK**: API 20

**Target SDK**: API 29

Android MVVM, master-detail app built in modern architecture using SOLID and CLEAN principles, that shows a beer catalog and allows user to interact with it changing beer availability. This development is part of a code challenge which requisites you can read [here](https://github.com/IsaacRF/android-mvvm-beercatalog/blob/master/ASSESSMENT.md)

### Adaptable layout
App is displayed in two pane mode on tablets, and master-detail navigation in phones, making the most of screen space. Navigation is made via Android's [Navigation Component](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation/navigation-getting-started) using [NavGraph](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation/navigation-getting-started#create-nav-graph) alongside two fragments (one for master and another one for detail). Fragments allow to easily configure layout distribution and navigation depending on screen size, and NavGraph allows to configure navigation transitions and required info in one place.

### MVVM Architecture
This project uses [MVVM](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/docs/guide) (Model - View - Viewmodel) architecture, via new [Jetpack ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) feature.

### Development Patterns
This project implements "By feature + layout" structure, [Separation of Concerns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns) pattern and [SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID) and Clean principles.

#### By feature + layout structure
Project architecture combines the "By feature" structure, consisting on separating all files concerning to a specific feature (for example, an app screen / section) on its own package, plus the "By layout" classic structure, separating all files serving a similar purpose on its own sub-package.

By feature structure complies with the Separation of Concerns and encapsulation patterns, also making the app highly scalable, modular and way easier to manipulate, as deleting or adding features impact only app base layer and refactor is minimum to non-existent.

Testing project replicates the same feature structure to ease test running separation

#### LiveData / Observable Pattern
Data is handled via [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata) / Observable Pattern instead of RxJava, as it's better performant and includes a series of benefits as, for example, avoiding manual app lifecycle management. Information retrieved from network is also stored on Room persistent DB to allow product availability manipulation and data cache.

***BeerListViewModel***
```Kotlin
val beerList: LiveData<NetworkResource<List<Beer>>> = beerListRepository.getBeers()
```

***BeerListFragment***
```Kotlin
//Observe live data changes and update UI accordingly
beerListViewModel.beerList.observe(this) {
    when(it.status) {
        Status.LOADING -> {}
        Status.SUCCESS -> {}
        Status.ERROR -> {}
    }
}
```

#### Dependency Inversion and Injection
Project implements Dependency Inversion (SOLI**D**) and Injection to isolate modules, avoid inter-dependencies and make testing easier

Dependency Injection is handled via [Hilt](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/hilt-android), a library that uses Dagger under the hood easing its implementation via @ annotations, and is developed and recommended to use by Google.

ViewModel is retrieved from activity to share it between master and detail fragments, allowing detail to modify data and reflect it on master list. The Module located on di package is in charge of defining implementations for everything that is injected in the app.

***GithubNdApp (App main class)***
```Kotlin
@HiltAndroidApp
class AndroidBaseApp : Application() {}
```

***MainActivity***
```Kotlin
@AndroidEntryPoint
class MainActivity : AppCompatActivity() {}
```

***BeerListFragment***
```Kotlin
class BeerListFragment : Fragment() {
    private val beerListViewModel: BeerListViewModel by activityViewModels()
}
```

***BeerListViewModel***
```Kotlin
class BeerListViewModel @ViewModelInject constructor (
    private val beerListRepository: BeerListRepository,
    @Assisted private val state: SavedStateHandle
) : ViewModel() {}
```

### Data
## API Calls
API Calls are handled via [retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/), declaring calls via an interface, and automatically deserialized by [Gson](https://github.com/google/gson) into model objects. This app manages to achieve retrofit abstraction using interfaces and call adapter factories.

[PUNK API endpoint](https://github.com/IsaacRF/android-mvvm-beercatalog/blob/master/ASSESSMENT.md)

***BeerListService***
```Kotlin
@GET("beers")
fun getBeers(
    @Query("page") page: Int,
    @Query("per_page") perPage: Int
): LiveData<ApiResponse<List<Beer>>>
```

## Local Storage
Cache and local storage is managed via [Room](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/room), using data classes as entities, and dao interfaces for DDBB access.

***Data class***
```Kotlin
@Entity
data class Beer (
    @PrimaryKey
    val id: Int, ...
)
```

***DAO***
```Kotlin
@Dao
abstract class BeerRoomDao: BeerDao {
    @Insert(onConflict = ABORT)
    abstract override fun insert(vararg beers: Beer)

    @Insert(onConflict = IGNORE)
    abstract override fun insert(beers: List<Beer>)

    @Update
    abstract override fun update(beer: Beer)

    @Query("SELECT * FROM Beer WHERE id = :beerId")
    abstract override fun load(beerId: Int): Beer?

    @Query("SELECT * FROM Beer")
    abstract override fun load(): LiveData<List<Beer>>
}
```

### Image rendering and caching
Beer images are rendered and cached using [EpicBitmapRenderer](https://github.com/IsaacRF/EpicBitmapRenderer), a Java Android library I also developed.

### Testing
All business logic, services and database interactions are tested 

Every test is isolated, and all API calls are mocked using [Mockito](https://site.mockito.org/) and okhttp [Mockwebserver](https://github.com/square/okhttp/tree/master/mockwebserver) to avoid test results to depend on external sources, becoming unrealiable and possibly leading to unexpected results.

Database is tested via a instrumentation test because best testing practices require a real device (or emulator) to test database interactions using Room in-memory database builder.
